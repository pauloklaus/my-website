    <p class="text-white">Hi! This is my personal homepage.</p>

    <p>
      I work with software development since 1998.
      In 2002 I started creating web applications using PHP/HTML/CSS/JS.
      I started using Bootstrap a few years later to speed up the creation of interfaces.
      I followed the rise of Angular and React.
      <span class="text-white">In 2018 I got in touch with the VueJS framework.</span>
      I started working with componentization in VueJS and this has been a differential for
      structuring large applications, applying good code writing practices in addition to
      facilitating the creation of cleaner interfaces, easier to test, maintain and grow.
    </p>

    <p>
      I feel like a <span class="text-white">Linux enthusiast</span>.
      I've been following the evolution for many years and using it as my operating system.

      Above, some links to my social networks and resources I keep available.

      In the playground beside it's possible to test some simple components that I made
      available in the npm repository.
